# British Airways Virtual Internship
This Internship has 2 tasks:
Task 1: Web scraping to gain company insights
British Airways (BA) wants to understand how people view the BA customer experience to make our operations run more efficiently and the customer experience even better.
For this task, I did web scraping using the beautiful soup library from that website, I took the information I need like customer reviews and service ratings. then I analyze the data and give me this insight:![wordcloud](https://github.com/Shrutikapedamkar/british-airways-virtual-internship/assets/47322770/3be96d63-d14d-4443-bcc2-481e2bc088ea)
Task 2 : Predicting customer buying behaviour
British Airways want to know what factors influence customers to complete or cancel their booking processes. For this task, I use Mutual information and found that Route, Booking_origin, Flight_duration, Wants_extra_baggage, Length_of_stay are the features that are more important for the customers to decide whether to complete the booking or not. Then I trained models using Random Forest and XGB classifiers.
